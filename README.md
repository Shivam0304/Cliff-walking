# Cliff-walking

Developed a Reinforcement Learning model for the
CliffWalking-v0 environment using Q-learning (off-policy) and SARSA (on-policy) algorithms. The
goal was to train an agent to navigate a grid world while avoiding cliffs and optimizing long-term
rewards. The model integrated an epsilon-greedy policy for balancing exploration and exploitation,
with hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.

Tools Used: Reinforcement Learning Algorithms, Q-learning (Off-policy TD control), SARSA (On-
policy TD control), Epsilon-Greedy Exploration Strategy, State-Action Value Optimization, OpenAI
Gym, NumPy, Pickle
